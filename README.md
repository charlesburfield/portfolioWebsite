This project was created via following and editing where I saw fit the following YouTube video: 
Responsive Portfolio Website From Scratch - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU&t=125s by How to Become a Developer
So most of the credit goes to them.

I decided I would like to create a simplistic webpage where I could showcase my projects and experience.
This will be continually updated in the future as I create more projects and hopefully gain more experience too.
